While the controller icon used in the logo and "separator" don't require any 
attribution, for the sake of "this is a school project" and just to be clear 
about it the icon was not made by any of us and acquired online. All the other 
icons in this project were made in Adobe Illustrator though as they were simple
enough to do so.
